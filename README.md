# Biosphere
Simulation of organisms using resources in biosphere

Usage:
   Create the biosphere
   Create the organisms
   Get the resources
   Run the biosphere
   
Inhabitants:
   There are two main types of organisms: Animal and Plant
   The animals of hte Biosphere are further subdivided into Bird(have feather and beak) and Fish (live under water, no limbs)
   All organisms need water and oxygen
   Only animals need food
   
 Output:
   getResources() should return the resources necessary given a list of organisms for simulation lastin X number of days   
   runSimulation() should output to the console the organisms still alive at the end of each day
 
 Sample output
   Required resources for 5 days...

   Oxygen x 260
   Water x 130
   Food x 50
   
   Running simulation...
   
   Day 1 - Parrot, Pigeon, Salmon, Trout, Rose, Pine
   Day 2 - Parrot, Pigeon, Salmon, Trout, Rose, Pine
   Day 3 - Parrot, Pigeon, Salmon, Trout, Rose, Pine
   Day 4 - Parrot, Pigeon, Salmon, Trout, Rose, Pine
   Day 5 - Parrot, Pigeon, Salmon, Trout, Rose, Pine
   
   Remaining resources after 5 days...
